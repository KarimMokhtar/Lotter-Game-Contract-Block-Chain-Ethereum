# Lotter-Game-Contract-Block-Chain-Ethereum
Dears, 
Please note that you have to install the dependencies to run this humble project.

Commands you will need:
npm init
npm install --save solc </br>
npm install --save mocha ganache-cli web3@1.0.0-beta.26 \n
npm install --save truffle-hdwallet-provider \n

and then create your Node on infura and put the link and your account pneumonic into the provider and have fun :)

please note that you can use ganache to test the contract on your own machine which is easier as i think.
