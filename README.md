Dears, 
Please note that you have to install the dependencies to run this humble project.

<B>Commands you will need:</B> </br>
npm init</br>
npm install --save solc </br>
npm install --save mocha ganache-cli web3@1.0.0-beta.26</br>
npm install --save truffle-hdwallet-provider</br>

and then create your Node on infura and put the link and your account pneumonic into the provider and have fun :)</br>

please note that you can use ganache to test the contract on your own machine which is easier as i think.
